    <h1>Stock Portfolio Visualizer</h1>
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I’ve been interested in investing since I was a kid. After winning a math competition in 2017, I wanted to manage my winnings wisely and decided to go with a proffesional to invest most of it. Unfortunately, the professional service I used charged high fees and consistently underperformed the market.</p>
<p>In 2020, right before COVID hit, I decided to take control of my investments and started managing them myself at 15. Since then, I’ve continued to invest, keeping a “safe” portfolio of VTI (total market index) alongside a self-managed growth portfolio.</p>
<p>Over time, I became frustrated with how limited most portfolio tools are, especially when it comes to backtesting. Most of the good ones are locked behind paywalls and I would much rather invest that money.</p>
<p>This project is my <strong>in-progress</strong> attempt to build what I wished existed: a clean, customizable tool for backtesting different portfolio strategies and viewing useful performance metrics.</p>
<h2 id="current-deployment">Current Deployment</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Calculator5329/stock-site"><strong>Source Code</strong></a> • <a href="https://cheery-tiramisu-028ceb.netlify.app/"><strong>Live Demo</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The backend is a Dockerized FastAPI app, deployed as an Azure App Service.</li>
<li>The frontend is built with Next.js (great for future features like login, saved portfolios, and SSR) and hosted on Netlify</li>
<li>Switched from CSVs to Pickle files, mostly for the superior name, but also for the much faster load times.</li>
<li>Used yfinance to get historical data, limited to S&amp;P500 companies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What's Next</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expand support to include bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.</li>
<li>Add stocks not included in the S&amp;P 500</li>
<li>Monte Carlo Simulations</li>
<li>Discounted Cash Flow tool</li>
<li>Login &amp; Saved portfolio tracking</li>
<li>Stock screener with fine-tuned LLM</li>
<li>Individual stock financials breakdown (An absurd amount of data)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Optimization techniques for rendering graphs and dynamic content in Next.js (hint: don't re-render complex graphs every time the page state updates)</li>
<li>Frontend design basics (layout, textures, gradients, and visualizing data with graphs)</li>
<li>Pickle files are the best (At least 10x more efficent than my csv files)</li>
<li>Using yfinance works, but it's so picky it's often better to just download the data manually</li>
</ul>
